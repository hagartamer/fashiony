            1. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information<br>
            We respect the privacy of the visitors to our digital properties and the users of our products and Services,
            and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Policy. We collect personal
            information when you use our Services.
            Personal information is any information that identifies or makes an individual identifiable. The definition
            of personal information (used interchangeably in this Privacy Policy with the term "personal data") depends
            on where you are a resident. Only the definition that applies to your country of residence will apply to you
            under this Privacy Policy.
            Personal Information does not include data that has been effectively irreversibly anonymized or aggregated
            so that it can no longer enable us or others, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to
            identify you.
            Your personal data is collected and used by us to support a range of different activities or business
            purposes. The purposes and types of information we collect are listed in the chart below, and should be
            understood to include uses of your personal data that are compatible with the purposes listed or uses that
            may be reasonably expected given the original purpose of collection.

            business maintenance and personalization continuity purposes, for instance so that you may enjoy a
            personalized user experience across our digital properties, to provide you with the Services, or to take

        <p id="PRIVACY & COOKIE POLICY">
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            3. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<br>
            We may use cookies, tags, web pixels, and similar technologies to automatically collect information on our
            Services. Cookies or tags are bits of code that allow our technology partners to collect information that
            usually does not directly identify you. If required by law, we will request your consent before using
            cookies or other tracking technologies. Information within this section describes our use of cookies and
            your ability to control the use of cookies for advertising-related purposes.
            A.Cookies . Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive
            through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember
            certain information.
            Generally, we use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes: to make our Services
            function properly; to provide a secure browsing experience during your use of our Services; to collect
            passive information about your use of our Services; to measure how you interact with our marketing
            campaigns; to help us improve our Services; and to remember your preferences for your convenience.
            We use the following types of cookies on our Services:
            Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are essential because they enable you to use our Services.
            Functional Cookies. We use functional cookies to remember your choices so we can tailor our Services to
            provide you with enhanced features and personalized content.
            Performance or Analytic Cookies. These cookies collect passive information about how you use our Services,
            including webpages you visit and links you click. We use the information collected by such cookies to
            improve and optimize our Services.
            Advertising or Targeting Cookies. These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.
            They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are
            properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your
            interests. Our third-party advertising partners may use these cookies to build a profile of your interests
            and deliver relevant advertising on other sites. You may disable the use of these cookies as set forth
            below.
            B.Your Choices . Your browser may provide you with the option to refuse some or all browser cookies. You may
            also be able to remove cookies from your browser. You can exercise your preferences in relation to cookies
            served on our Services by taking the steps outlined below.
            First-Party Cookies. You can use the browser with which you are viewing this Site to enable, disable or
            delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the
            “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” settings). Please note, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be
            able to access secure areas of the Site. Also, if you disable cookies other parts of the Services may not
            work properly. You can find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at
            https://www.allaboutcookies.org .
            Third-Party Cookies. Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are
            members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which
            maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out of
            website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit
            the DAA’s opt-out portal available at https://optout.aboutads.info/ , or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal
            available at https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1 . Residents of the European Union may opt-out of
            online behavioral advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s
            participating member organizations by visiting https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ . For more information
            about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, please see
            https://www.aboutads.info/consumers .
            We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising.
            However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or
            used in this way. In addition, most web browsers provide help pages relating to setting cookie preferences.
            More information may be found for the following browsers here: Google Chrome , Internet Explorer , Mozilla
            Firefox , Safari (Desktop) , Safari (Mobile) , Android Browser , Opera Mobile .
            C.Web Pixels . To see how successfully our marketing campaigns or other goals of the Services are performing
            we sometimes use conversion pixels, which fire a short line of code to tell us when you have clicked on a
            particular button or reached a particular page (e.g. a thank you page once you have completed the procedure
            for subscribing to one of our services or have completed one of our forms). We also use web pixels to
            analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device,
            browser, or application has visited a particular webpage.
            D.Analytics . We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Services.
            Presently, we use Google Analytics . Google Analytics is a web analytics service that tracks and reports
            Site traffic. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &
            Terms web page: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en . Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides
            visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics, available
            at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .
            E.Behavioral Remarketing . We also use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you
            after you visited our Services. For this purpose, visitors are grouped by certain actions on our Services,
            e.g., by duration of a visit. This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalized
            advertising even if you are currently surfing on another website that also participates in the same
            advertising network. We utilize Google Ads, Bing Ads, and similar ad networks.
            F.Other Tracking Technologies . Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets
            embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including
            accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components;
            entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within
            your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to
            be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is
            revisited.
            G.Do Not Track . Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability
            to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT" signals have not been
            adopted, our Site does not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.

            4. Security Precautions<br>
            We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to guard and prevent misuse of your
            personal information. Our security measures include industry-standard physical, technical and administrative
            measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information.
            The Internet is not an absolutely secure environment. We strongly recommend that you use a secure method and
            use a complex password to help us ensure the security of your account. We also strongly advise that you
            neither share your password with others nor re-use passwords on our Services that you use on other sites or
            apps, as doing so increases the likelihood of your being the victim of a credential stuffing attack or other
            malicious cyber behavior. If you feel that the security of your account or personal data has been
            compromised, please immediately contact us at our dedicated Privacy Center or as otherwise described in the
            “Contact Us” section below.

            5.1 Access, Rectification and Deletion of your Personal Information. You have the right to access, rectify,
            or delete the personal information that we collect. To protect the privacy and the security of your personal
            information, we may request data from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access such
            data, as well as to search for and provide you with the personal data we maintain. There are instances where
            applicable laws or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refuse to provide or delete some or all of
            the personal information that we maintain. To exercise your rights, you may make updates within your
            customer account on the Site or App, or you may contact us our dedicated Privacy Center . We may not
            accommodate a request to delete or change information if we believe the change would violate any law or
            legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
            5.2 Unsubscribe from Our Marketing Communications. If you no longer wish for us to use your email account to
            send you marketing emails or non-transactional promotional materials, please directly click on the

            6. Retention<br>
            We will retain your personal information for the purposes set out in this Policy, and for backup, archival,
            fraud prevention or detection, or audit purposes. We also will retain and use your personal information to
            the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your
            data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
            If you no longer wish to be our customer, or cease using or accessing our Services, you can request us to
            close your account and delete all personal information we hold about you via Privacy Center (See section
            11), subject to certain legal requirements.
            If you send us correspondence, including emails, we retain such information electronically in the records of
            your account. We will also electronically retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence
            from us to you. We retain these records to measure and improve our customer service and to investigate
            potential fraud and violations. We may, over time, delete these records as permitted by law.
            We will also retain Services usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for
            a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
            functionality of our Site, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.

            8. Children<br>
            Our Services are not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, children under
            the age of 16 or minors (as defined by applicable national laws). If you are a minor, please do not attempt
            to fill out our forms or send any personal information about yourself to us. If a minor has provided us with
            personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us (See
            Section 11) immediately to remove the relevant personal information and unsubscribe the minor.
            If we become aware that a minor has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to promptly
            delete such information from our files. As described further in our Terms and Conditions, please do not
            upload photographs showing other people, in particular if they are minors.

            9. Social Media Accounts<br>
            We operate accounts and fan pages on different social media platforms (the "Social Media Accounts" ), such
            as on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , YouTube , Pinterest , Snapchat and TikTok . If you visit one of our
            Social Media Accounts you initiate a variety of data processing operations. If you do not provide us with
            your personal data, certain functionalities of the social networking platforms requiring such data will not
            be available to you or only to a limited extent.
            As the owner of a Social Media Account, we can usually only see information stored in your public profile on
            such social media platform, and only insofar as you are logged in to your profile while visiting our Social
            Media Account. In addition, we may process data that you provide to us when you contact us through one of
            our Social Media Accounts (for example: if you create a post, or send us a private message via Facebook). If
            you visit one of our Social Media Accounts, the operator of the respective social network also processes
            your data, regardless of whether you yourself have a profile in the respective social network. The
            individual data processing operations and their scope differ depending on the operator. In addition, the
            respective operator of the social network provides us with anonymous usage statistics, which we use to
            improve the user experience.

            When you access or use our Services, your personal data may be processed or transferred outside of the
            country in which you reside. Such countries or jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are
            different in some respects or less protective than the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. If you
            do not want your information transferred to, processed, or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction
            where you reside, you should immediately stop accessing or using the Services. For further details about
            these transfers and the safeguards that we use to facilitate such transfers, please contact us at our
            dedicated Privacy Center .

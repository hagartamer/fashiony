            identification, you will be deemed to be authorized to access and use the Site or Apps in a manner
            consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Company has no obligation to investigate
            the authorization or source of any such access or use of the Services.
            You will be solely responsible for all access to and use of the Services by anyone using the password and
            identification originally assigned to you whether or not such access to and use of this Site is actually

            (including, without limitation, financial obligations) incurred through such access or use. You are solely

            by the entity set forth in Clause 1.1 (Scope) of the terms and conditions governing the use of that Site

            issued by the Company via the Services. Subject to the terms below, Wallet credits, gift cards, promotional
            coupons and promotional points stored in your Wallet can only be redeemed with the Company in connection
            with purchase of products from the Company, and not for any other purpose. The Wallet is accessible at any
            time via the local Site or App in the section "My Assets".
            Promotional Points: Promotional points can be earned and stored under “My Assets” by using our Services

            discretion; they are subject to expiration and cancellation by the Company. Promotional points can only be
            redeemed on the site through which they were granted (for example, if promotional points were granted on the
            br.shein.com site, then they can only be redeemed on that site).Promotional Points may not be redeemed as
            cash or returned via PayPal or the Debit/Credit Card used to make the original purchase.
            Coupons: Coupons can be purchased from the Company from time to time or may be granted by the Company in its
            sole discretion. Coupons may be stored under “My Assets.” Coupons are subject to expiration and cancellation
            by the Company. Our website coupons that were purchased can only be redeemed on the site on which they were
            purchased (for example, if coupons were purchased on the br.shein.com site, then they can only be redeemed
            on that site). The redemption of Our website coupons granted by the Company free of charge is subject to
            limitations imposed in the Company's sole discretion from time to time. Coupons may not be redeemed as cash
            or returned via PayPal or the Debit/Credit Card used to make the original purchase.
            Wallet Credit: Wallet credit can be stored in your Wallet by returning goods and choosing a wallet credit as
            your refund option. Wallet credits can only be redeemed on the site through which the wallet credit was
            granted (for example, if you ordered and subsequently returned a product on the br.shein.com site and
            elected to receive a credit, that wallet credit can only be redeemed on the br.shein.com site). To the
            extent permitted by applicable laws, a wallet credit linked to a returned item can be withdrawn in cash to
            the original method of payment used when you placed the order. A wallet credit granted by the Company that
            is not linked to a returned item cannot be redeemed in cash.

            Account. Gift cards purchased after March 8, 2021 can only be redeemed on the site on which they were
            purchased (for example, if a gift card was purchased after March 8, 2021 on br.shein.com, then that gift
            card can only be redeemed on that site). The redemption of gift cards granted by the Company free of charge
            may be used on Other Our website Sites subject to limitations imposed in the Company’s sole discretion from
            time
            to time. Gift cards may not be redeemed as cash or returned via PayPal or the Debit/Credit Card used to make
            the original purchase.
            You can use wallet credits, gift cards, paid or free coupons and promotional points that are stored under
            "My Assets" as an additional payment option or discount to be used on the Site, subject to the applicable
            terms above and the provisions available under Bonus Points . While wallet credits received from an order
            return can be refunded to the original method of payment, wallet credits granted by the Company, promotional
            points, coupons and gift cards cannot be redeemed for cash.
            The Wallet is provided as part of the user account and is subject to the same provisions as set forth in

            5.1 Price and Payment. All prices are correct at the time of entering the information on to the system. If
            for some reason we are unable to ship your goods, the value of the items that are not shipped will be
            refunded to your wallet in your User Account or to the original method of payment, whichever you so select.
            All prices are exclusive of delivery charges. The total cost of the order is the price of the products
            ordered plus the delivery charge.
            Prices may change at any time, but (other than as set out above) changes shall not affect the orders for
            which we have sent an Order Confirmation.
            Once you have selected all articles that you wish to buy, they will be added to your bag. The next step will
            be to process the order and make the payment. To that end, you must follow the steps of the purchase
            process, indicating or verifying the information requested in each step. Furthermore, throughout the
            purchase process, before payment, you can modify the details of your order. You are provided with a detailed

            complete the transaction. The charge on your card will be made at the time of your order unless you selected
            a pay later service (which is only available in certain countries) in which case your card will be charged
            at the time of shipment or you selected a COD (cash on delivery) service (which is only available in certain

            the credit card is yours. Credit cards are subject to verification and authorization by the card issuing
